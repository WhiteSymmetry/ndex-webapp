    <h2>NDEx - the Network Data Exchange</h2>

    <p class="about-section">The NDEx project provides a public website where scientists
        and organizations can share, store, manipulate, and publish biological network knowledge.

    <p class="about-section">Users can also run their own copies of the NDEx Server software in cases where the
        stored networks must be kept in a highly secure environment (such as for HIPAA compliance) or
        where high application load is incompatible with a shared public resource. <p>

    <p class="about-section">The NDEx framework is an entirely open-source software system that is part of the 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a> family. It is a project of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cytoscapeconsortium.org">Cytoscape
        Consortium</a> in conjunction with the <a target="_blank" href="http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx">
        Ideker lab at the UCSD School of Medicine.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="about-section">Technical details for NDEx are documented at the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cytoscape/ndex/wiki">NDEx
        GitHub Repository Wiki</a>.

        <h2>NDEx is a Network Commons</h2>

        <p class="about-section">NDEx provides a commons where the rapidly expanding corpus of
            biological network models created by researchers can be shared, discussed, reviewed, and used. 
            It is public forum where biologists can exchange and publish
            computable network models io many types and formats. </p>

        <div class="slide-div"><img class="slide" src="img/about/ndex_formats.jpg"/></div>

        <p class="about-section">One of the goals of the project is to create a home for network models
            that are currently available only
            as figures, tables, or supplementary
            information, such as network models produced via systematic mining and integration of large-scale molecular
            data.</p>

        <p class="about-section"><b>The NDEx project does not compete with existing pathway and interaction databases</b>,
            such as Pathway Commons, KEGG, or Reactome; instead, NDEx provides a novel, common distribution channel for
            these efforts, preserving their identity and attribution rather than subsuming them.</p>

        <p class="about-section">As with popular file-sharing systems such as Google Docs, or DropBox,
            NDEx users manage access to the content that they upload. In this example, one user has
            read-only access to a network uploaded by another user. </p>

        <div class="slide-div"><img class="slide" src="img/about/ndex_user_managed_content.jpg"/> </div>


        <p class="about-section">Each user in the system has a home page, analogous to an account on LinkedIn or
            Facebook. At that page, the user can manage their account and other users can see the information and
            networks that the user has made public or has shared with them.</p>

        <p class="about-section">NDEx is based on a REST web API which can be accessed by any
            application, including the NDEx website and the NDEx Cytoscape App. </p>

        <p class="about-section">Lightweight applications and scripts will be able to
            access and manipulate networks via
            the NDEx API, making it easy for scientists to develop novel network based analyses. </p>

            history of Cytoscape plug-ins, the NDEx project support the community in the creation of
            new utilities and analytic tools using NDEx via code examples, client libraries
            in multiple languages, and developer documentation. </p>

        <h2>NDEx is a Publication Medium</h2>
        <p class="about-section">The NDEx platform is intended to enable experimentation with novel
            forms of scientific review and discourse.</p>

        <p class="about-section">NDEx networks are assigned stable, globally unique URIs and so can
            be referenced by publications, by other networks, and by analytic applications.</p>

        <h3>Network Provenance History</h3>

        <p class="about-section">Each NDEx network can include a provenance history structure,
            enabling applications to record a history of “ancestor” networks and events leading
            to the network in its current state.  (see
            <a arget="_blank" href="https://github.com/cytoscape/ndex/wiki/Data-Model:-Provenance-History">
                Provenance History</a> for details).
        </p>

        <div class="slide-div"><img class="slide" src="img/about/provenance_history.jpg"/></div>


        <h3>Immutable Networks</h3>
        <p class="about-section">The stability of published content is critical to the scientific process – in
            order to meaningfully review a published network or to build hypotheses or draw conclusions based on
            network knowledge, the referenced network must be a constant, immutable entity.</p>

        <p class="about-section">In upcoming releases of NDEx, it will be possible to make selected
            networks immutable, creating stable published versions as durable references.</p>

        <div class="slide-div"><img class="slide" src="img/about/network_publication.jpg"/></div>

        <p class="about-section">Note that NDEx distinguishes the mutability of networks from the
            access control: some public networks may be constantly updated while others are stable
            references. Some private networks may be immutable, stable references with access
            limited to a specific set of users.</p>

        <p class="about-section">A further point is that the NDEx public site only plays the role of a “fair broker”,
            providing the infrastructure for networks to be stored, shared, and but not making any claims about
            the value or correctness of any network content. Networks in NDEx should derive their credibility based
            on their publisher, or based on review by other scientists and organizations.

        <h2>Running a Local NDEx</h2>


        <p class="about-section">The NDEx server software can be deployed to create a local site, including
            selected content mirrored from the public NDEx site. This enables the creation of both secure
            private repositories and local, application-dedicated caches for compute or storage intensive
            situations.

        <div class="slide-div"><img class="slide" src="img/about/cytoscape-ndex.jpg"/></div>

        <p class="about-section">As a first step in integration, the NDEx Cytoscape App enables users to access the
