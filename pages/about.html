        <h2>The Need for a Network Commons</h2>

        <p class="ndex-section">The scientific community needs a commons where the rapidly expanding corpus of
            biological network models created by researchers can be shared, discussed, reviewed, and used. This is
            especially true for network models produced via systematic mining and integration of large-scale molecular
            data. </p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Presently, many network models are available only as figures, tables, or supplementary
            information in articles, often published in journals that target bioinformatic audiences rather than those
            with biological, pharmaceutical, or clinical interests. </p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Although repositories of biological pathways and databases of molecular interactions are
            readily accessible, there is currently no public forum where biologists can easily exchange and publish
            computable network models of all types and formats. </p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Moreover, there is no central resource where network models of different types can be
            found by their relevance to particular genes, functions, or diseases, and there is a need for streamlined
            mechanisms whereby scientists can acquire the content of these networks in easily computable forms.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Finally, there is no facile infrastructure for pre-publication sharing and inspection of
            these complex models among collaborators, impeding biological interpretation and review, and slowing the
            development of biological network-related algorithms.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">As a result, many network models remain largely inaccessible to those who have the most
            knowledge to interpret them and the most to gain from their successful interpretation. </p>

        <h2>NDEx and the Community</h2>

        <p class="ndex-section">To address this need, the NDEx project will create a durable, collaborative web resource
            to capture knowledge of the structure and function of molecular networks. The NDEx system will be comprised
            of (1)<b> a freely available, open-source server platform</b> and (2) a <b>public website</b> built on that
            platform.
            Researchers will use NDEx to access, share, and publish biological knowledge in multiple network formats.
        </p>

        <p class="ndex-section"><b>The NDEx project does not compete with existing pathway and interaction databases</b>,
            such as Pathway Commons, KEGG, or Reactome; instead, NDEx provides a novel, common distribution channel for
            these efforts, preserving their identity and attribution rather than subsuming them.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">The NDEx project is poised to play a role synergistic with existing programs and
            resources in systems biology and bioinformatics.

        <p>

        <p class="ndex-section">The Ideker lab is a member of the Sage Bionetworks Federation and, together with Sage,
            will fully integrate NDEx with the Synapse system.

        <p>

        <p class="ndex-section">The NDEx project will work with groups creating systems that provide access to clinical
            measurement data, pharmacological data, and other data relevant to research and drug discovery, such as
            eTRIKS/tranSMART and Open PHACTS, providing a storage and communication mechanism for networks derived by
            analyses of these data.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">As with popular file-sharing systems such as Google Docs, <b>NDEx users will create
            accounts and then manage access to the content that they upload</b>. In this example, Jane grants access
            permission to Cindy for a network that Jane owns.

            users and groups interact by sharing networks. As in file sharing systems like Google Docs or Dropbox,
            users control access to the networks that they store in NDEx.
            In this example, Jane Jones owns the network that she has created. She then grants permission for Cindy Cho to
            access the network.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Each user in the system has a home page, analogous to an account on LinkedIn or

        </p>

        <img class="slide" src="img/about/ndex_formats.png"/>

        <p class="ndex-section">
            Scientists using NDEx will have a unified interface to search models
            of all types: simple and sophisticated, large and small, data-derived, text-mined, or manually curated.
            This juxtaposition of diverse networks expressed in a common environment will provide an
            unmatched opportunity to compare and contrast models, aiding researchers in hypothesis generation
            and model refinement.
        </p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Full semantic interoperability between existing network formats is an open issue,
            therefore the NDEx project will focus on task-oriented format translation services developed to support
            specific use cases.</p>

<!-- NDEx as a Publication Medium -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="span1"></div>
    <div class="span8">
        <h2>NDEx is a Publication Medium</h2>

        <p class="ndex-section">Beyond sharing, NDEx permits the publication of stable versions of networks.
            Networks can
            be explicitly created as dated versions including publication meta- data. Published versions
            are immutable and are assigned stable URIs and DOIs, making the networks and their contents
            suitable for reference by publications, by other networks, and by analytic applications.</p>

        <img class="slide" src="img/about/ndex_publication1.png"/>

        <p class="ndex-section">In this example, the Jones Lab created a model of RBL2 and E2F4 interaction.
            When it was ready to publish, a locked - immutable - version was created and made publically accessible</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">The stability of published content is critical to the scientific process – in
            order to meaningfully review a published network or to build hypotheses or draw conclusions based on
            network knowledge, the referenced network must be a constant, immutable entity.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">NDEx therefore distinguishes the act of <i>publication</i> from the
            granting of <i>access</i>: a network may be <i>published</i> but
            only <i>accessible</i> to a limited group.</p>

        <p class="ndex-section">Moreover, <i>publication</i> is also distinct from <i>review</i> – the NDEx site
            only plays the role of a “fair broker”, providing the infrastructure for networks to be stored, shared, and
            published.
            The NDEx site itself makes no claims about the value or correctness of any network content. Networks
            derive their credibility based on their publisher, or based on review by other scientists and organizations.
            The NDEx platform will thereby enable experimentation with novel forms of scientific review and discourse.
